Still I know I must give up: the betweenness 
forwards up to gander edge like ivy round the  
the hill I trembled on as a boy 
I wanted to learn how to ride a bike 
do not ask me where I am going 
I may not return 

									
Arabelle asks: Would you stay     a while
longer? with sewing scissors, she cuts
she cuts from a paisley—the seeds, elderly 
like baby buds apostrophes could
not possess her lack of custody… as if 
the pattern could leave the fabric… as if
beyond her maternity shirt are kite
migrations of no return 
her heart-spool knotted a knife horizon’s
of ships delivery my father’s Iliad in a folded flag.
Birds nest, fern’s ear, bath tub hurricanes 
blue pills, Andromeda and other navel-y things:
her mind is want with… holding these things

Her mind is want: withholding these things
With a very sharp needle she stitches
the Klimt-lings to old photos —this one, folded.
‘89 horizon divides two postnatal blues; 
in a one-piece. Stuck. One hand. Forever. 
reaching. A bud light. The othe
shouldering the crease. I see now, her 
skin thin and translucent as if it would 
just lift away like linen revealing 
a little dandelion girl     again sighing  
clouds into the faces of husbands.
—the bird’s line the sky palms—our
distance and entropy.   Did     I not  love you 
enough; was what my mother meant to ask

IV: Puerto Rico to Port St. John

Through sepia windows they gaze into the present
all my possible grandfathers in a photo album
Tilina  ‘shining one a tiny waist’ they call her 
with each she leans deeper into their flags and coat 
—“TINA!” the ancient marine umbiliculled 
to an oxygen tank roars—her name is Aracelis, 
she taps a cigarette in your direction, gazing
through the sliding doors, as siesta sun pulls the sweat 
of migrant workers towards the shore— to no grandchild
in particular I ask:  if I might have not been      me  could 
I then    have been you?  —diamonds on their dirty brows   
los sleepwalkers  she calls them, we watch, every summer 
climb bright ladders into houses without ceilings

XI: Avery Senior Center 2025

sky blue   clear pillbox these seven trapdoors of the week 
open this copy-pasted neighborhood where today my
mother calls me Oswaldo  so I am Oswaldo and she is
Arabelle full of radiation we are taking up water
colors because she is tired of the infinitive 
loop of telenovelas.    When I donate her
painting to Goodwill it is so I can return in a week 
as Andy Warhol and say the fluorescence 
hits the canvas and the houses blur into a night without 
separation a bird or a woman in a bird suit flaps their 
arms under the streetlight the halo of piss upon her was
sadness leaving the body until sleepless the son
came whiskey and clozapine in fists to ransom 
her back into my suburban arms round the etceteras



XIV: Arcadia

Determinism is the theory that at Abuela’s family reunion 
when all mouths are full of rum-cake 
then Rafi (even after he died) and his battered guitar 
will apparate from a cloud of musk cologne and 
cigar smoke 
  he will smile     somehow at all of us 
and begin a merengue   
Don Herme clave bird chirps 
		and timbales
		rumble rumba retumba now
the stabs of latin brass 
    the quixotic lancers from the 
Atlantic winds of a red accordion
 regardless of not having 
heard it before     we all know   how it goes  
    Rafi
pulls islands 
                 a pangea of faces: maps of the same 
mislabelled India
           as drunken mothers swim to the       
 children’s table
      we gazing       into various delphis     I held you when you 
were a baby     they want to hold us 
I would save them
but they just want to dance–so I lie: 
ahh, I remember 
I now know how they believed me
seeing my own sugar cane baby cousin nephew nieces aging so fast
     as if they've got someone or somewhere to be 
but between the bacchus and bachata
 old dominoes clink and fall 
the tabled salad of old potato men 
swear and spill their drinks
to pan 
in our directions 
they wink     a deal:   
one modelo    for and a wet cliche
the kaleidoscope 
all exploring for the single point
    the secret     
each  
promised it 
to you    if you would
only just listen   
and the secret was always departing 
	was always arriving 
we wonder what old tomes
        bald under their arcane fedoras     what sacred bird was lanced
    for the elemental feathers in the leather bands
          could this hell bent rainbow be mine one day?
The old fauns 
are forced to surrender
they  wince
in witness to the dance of daughters   
unweaving the city of unpluckable
flowers from their blouses
staring straight into the coal dark eyes of their
fathers and husbands
their white hem begin to lift 
this time by their own will     and they  forget
about trying to forget    what did not have to be       or		 is it  
when the resonance of Rafi’s last chord  leaves 
up     so too      the women 
   like UFOs sail up through the ceiling   
before anyone has a chance
    to grasp them
not women now but     
a single odyssey 
  	the children lastly
 see the     
         callused moons and bunions   
         			   their clothes
fall
without them
landing on moorish tiles  
folded 
beside curlers, mops, and other cleaning supplies

She sketched       the day 
they were forced into the dark 
was the day 
they argued 
human history 
should not begin
with the breaking of wild horses.
The gesture 
on the calcium 
walls of her exile:
charcoal frict with spit 
with fingertips dim lit and
deep in the damp 	
intestines of the cave, 		
what she did not sketch
were the men and millenia
mounting horses above
the Iliad and Americas
the forged illusions 
of bronze and war.
In the flickering torch light 	
human vision degrades	
into movement even when all is still—   
the boundaries between
objects become harder
to distinguish	
a sequence
of many horses
animated by fire
in her eyes the
many horses
became one gallop 
and airborne 
with all four hooves lifting
above the ground
we are not ourselves
in this moment but
what was in 
the fire
was feral 
for the art 
for the lover would 
risk her skin
to touch 
the dying ember
and shadow
and marble smoke
of the horses 
in the stone 
wall standing 
its own gravity
before the 
archaeologist
and his headlamp.

I saw the wild horses 
of Assateague
they run so hard 
and fast against the shore
they could run right off the edge 
of the world and not know it

Bluebell thinks of Bees  
 
No one  –Not even you can persuade me
otherwise: If I must die then I did /someday
Sunday morning began as bluebells present
their ovaries to Oklahoma begin
my morning drunk on the syllable of bees on God
I will set you all on fire / for character
development / line break        	
Will I no dog the sea’s hung maw
through your hair and comb and foam
and rain and bow to split lick infinitives:
you who tends
the boney mounds of Carlisle
don’t you dare mistake
my bent neck for sentiment
 
If I must live then  you must not
ask me twice,
what yellow melic calls me
you have made me
into a dirty old man handstand in a
hamper of your delicates
stuffed with
noses and goldenrods
I could be ten thousand bees fainting
in a jasmine sea
Miles way tonight
your hair all long along
your hips, so rhomb, on nothing
I was supposed to be a photograph
of a ladder
in a hotel lobby
 
Bluebell and the Moon
 
 
I remember a grandfather clock
Stood in the hallway like
a visitor
the spring came
and up her bluebells up
the stairs the darkest hair
is brushed before the darkest mirror
inside the darkest room
 
Outside of tense
The dream evenwhile
dreamed exists only
in memory     	its garden
the boy painted
‘The Boy         	Who Exists
Only in the Spring’
he wanted to sleep beside a woman
 
she wanted to die holding a rifle
in the arms of a stranger
named Fayetteville, NC
I will bury Fayetteville, NC
in an airfield
She will come	I will
Say: stay with me Bluebell
I am the boy here
it is always night
if you shoot I will not
awaken in your hair
I will awaken in the weeds

Ruby in the porno theater    from behind   his bald head a-garlanded with a-silvered hair    Ruby is dreaming. In the dream she is throwing orchid petals in the water because Ruby has placed his large hand on her knee to sort the folds. As he dreams      the usher places a coat over     Ruby’s body       and imagines the coat     is a closet Ruby or the moon hangs himself up in every night      (the usher would   follow behind    and in the morning when she, Ruby’s wife asks Ruby where Ruby was all night     the usher would waltz out of Ruby’s coat like smoke and say) nowhere…

In the early morning I was the mennonite daughter stepping out of a red barn
sighing the faces of husbands in the milk that rippled in the pail and in the early morning
I was the moon     and the moon was       looking at an old man and his       blue wagon filled with yet cut      stone a mule dragged it       the mule had a burdensome      hard on his penis was hitting        the bottom of his stomach       in a tempo all around us       the mule gnashed his bridle        we all admired       that the beast prayed       in such a cold         and lonely   fashion. It was the early morning I was        the moon and       the moon was       an old man covered 
in dew and     the dew was        a field covered in dew

I would this poem make love to me       how     embarrassing    make its worddress 
though you prefer Van Gogh’s shoes heavy with rainwater in the doorway you walked of       when the end of this poem came      to me it was beautiful and brave in the give-up       felt like a green carpet over mountains   and water without a hint of ice    a few billowing clouds: I paint your last argument–fuck your art     on the foreground as Hokusai’s great wave begins to slouch      here the moon is looking over your shoulder as you      and your shadow step out –outside a crowded art gallery   into my ear  you whisper:    I want –I want to fuck in public

when Ruby sit on the edge of the bed like he’s praying and says     I’m sorry this usually doesn’t happen    he doesn’t want you to ask if it was your fault     even worse he doesn’t want you to say it’s okay    he wants you to put your hands inside him    and pull out that beach ball called shame in his gut      and toss it in the air a bit     he wants you to say  (your hand (on mine in yours) on mine) this is a bouquet of parentheses –when you touch me you touch my skin (at least)     In my dreams   you ask me to carry it for you so you carry it for you I carry it with your hands like (      )   

they fight for the girls back home who say thank you for your service in the middle of a lap dance their minds spin like a pine needle spinning on a broken spider’s thread     on the way home a soldier’s headlights are swallowed into the black hole eyes of a deer and he thinks of an Afghan boy holding a rifle   at 2am in  Fayetteville the soldiers are trying their damndest to fall asleep 	each one   each head is an intersection of thread a spider’s web as large as the city   and the web makes a portrait       and if that moon is The Green Door they will open it and cross the foreign country between one who is dreaming and one who is sleepless beside the dreamer    and awake in the empty bus station of 3am with her and one ticket	they do not have a name for this betweenness of night and morning in their language but she does and she whispers it        into each man's ear so they place these words     into a little box they lift the roof off of every now and again and it is a little girl     dreaming of a country she will never see     and     it becomes a stage bathed in moonlight where the men try their damndest to fall asleep 	      each head an intersection of a spider’s web as large as a city 		 they spend decades trying to decipher whether the portrait in the web belongs to the spider or the fly	 until they find themselves wrapped in her hair and she calls them a rockstar and says on an earth so full of violence we had the nerve to make love she says this in a language they do not understand and it crashes hard on their ears like artillery or shower water            through the window   the moon is as far     it was then but it is never here    and     in Afghanistan

And now I think of my friend B–who lost more than he should have. For three nights his mother, Z– read the sacred prayers and wailed into a carpet; on the fourth she buried a skull cap in the yard. Having no religion, I write the sacred prayer: Allah, must I, too, prostrate in a field blue with dandelions, be drowning/ He died then lamplight. 
the Gospel According to a Rooster
The day before he died
I tell the man    	you are the only animal that cages 
other animals		
      with his tongue he carves a line in the dirt ‘I’
and says: 	“everything east   
                        is yours     everything west is mine”
   I fly east 	in a straight line by noon I
wind up on his side    
              this upsets him 
	after my travel I tell him I can now confirm         you are the only animal 
that cages other animals
        with a knife he carves into wood
my image into a word
then four walls around the image 
says: “everything outside the box is mine”
		he does not realize 
       the same inverse principle 	still applies

      so I warn him      for the last time         thine are the only animal 
that cages thineself		to this
he builds walls around his neighbors       this upsets them    
    by evening
    	he installs my image onto iron
		on top of the weather-vane to spin in every direction 
       midnight in violent winds I am
spinning on the roof I tell him below        the stars are so beautiful tonight I might write a poem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    
but he can not see them in the dark 		|	      at least you have a roof and walls
nor all his supposed possessions		|		 I heard
nor his dark subjects				|		             him
their white gnashing teeth			|---------------------------------  weeping:
one neighbor sharpening flint    a spark   grunts:		      	                                “I am only an animal...”

Orthology: Zwanenndael-Whorekill-Lewes

 
Language falls from the sky—
		No, that’s ornithology.
A group of feeding vultures—
		Is called a wake
The Ark and Dove’s scar on the ocean, Longitude, 1634—
		Is just negotiations with the wind
Father White and Co. manifest on the bay and say—
		“Who are you hiding from?”
Fate, your shore arrives perpendicular to mine.
		Like the proverbial rain of gunfire.
Language separating from the body—
		You mean to say your mother’s
Language disarticulating from the bones—
		No, that’s anthropology
The intestines are red on the road—
		Whose calligraphy?
The passenger pigeon is not flying—
		Bad bird
There is no India to return to—
		Bad Indian
The vulture is prelinguistic—
		A cartographic legend
Cardinals. Departs the shore.
		A boy Columbus holds a shell to his ear
In their arteries, like rivers—
		Swans yearn for the ocean
Semantics: a bird is a bird—
		You must excommunicate subject from object
A bird’s shadow contains its own diaspora—
		Bury the bird
I eat the bird. I flap my arms. 
		What is the etymology of your survival?
The vulture’s ark. Skyward.
		The orthology of migration?
Scavenger; boundlessness.
		The grammar of solitude?
Foreign map; latitude, 1672.
		What is language using you for?
A sailor raises a moorish lantern.
And the vulture’s shadow?
It makes a cross upon his back.	

 
1/∞ Passenger Pigeon

if: an intention in 
direction flees a passenger 
pigeon to the vanishing 
palace of wants and only if 
I close this book and cage 
my many hours
surveying this
categorically extinct language
as you grieve
regardless of the language
silence is the same
silence in your eyes 
and your approaching hand
my axis of satisfaction and
however finite 
flees me to somewhere 
prelinguistic, 
imaginary, and sadly
temporary. 

Then: there is no word 
in English for what 
I think is the sensation of my
fingers lifting the lateral edge 
of your neckline and baby hairs 
but there is a field 
beneath this city
it is dreaming
it is intimate with 
your mother’s childhood 
in the soft parting 
of your lips for a moment 
the wind fills
your dress
with a war of blind chimeras
surrendering to love of
(extinction)
your pigeon feet
my book too 
the wind opens 
I imagine 
in desperate 
want of a single word for this




 
Ars Poetica

I tell him, my friend 		writing a good poem…is like         
 leading travelers through a thick and ancient forest
don’t leave them stranded in the 	   middle of it;	  
you have to find a way out
For example: two roads diverge
 25km west of the Polish border with Belarus
a pink scooter and unsoled shoes—		
do not look—and you mistake was always arriving 
for a frozen boy beneath the pine 
and though the wind flouts numb the root and marrow
I promise
the border patrol camera proves there is still heat in you.

—his country was a red wheelbarrow
Every morning I step into the confession booth
of Al Jazeera–he used to carry his younger brother in 	
a refugee in a broken puffer was taken 
to Wędrzyn Detention Center–after the bombings
sits outside the 24 hours news cycle–beneath the rublle
and his head is so heavy—what couldn’t be separated from tomatoes, w
 he has to hold–what remained of his little brother
it in his hands
The reporter says what 
remained of his  little brother he had to carry in a plastic bag
the reporter reports they say 
he needs psychological help;		
we say 
so much depends  
he  needs      help he says he needs   
a s y l u m		he says he	knows he	
came here illegally he was born he		but he  doesn’t know he
why this is 	   happening to    he 
he is	 he says 	 he isn’t leaving this beautiful country—	so an armed grunt 
with a face so sour         you’d think he was      a poet   seizes him.    The man was about my age
and presented to us a sheet of paper     
the camera could not pick up what was legible     
it might have been a map
one road leads	to a yellow 	taxi then      the airport		then the UK 	where his mother 
lives         and  there is         another road–			the man in black forcibly escorts him

into her empty: suitcase houses the greyhounds sterilizing: fluorescence: my grandmother stares—all her privacies on the terminal—she is not looking: for anything: as a bruja does with chicken bones in the embers: she is: everything but her now: and since she has passed it’s like I’ve been past my bedtime for 27 years—the bus arrives without me and the driver’s grecian brim nods one wobbling foot at a time—I’ve been standing here cold and tired, wondering if I should fold the clothes. I am anything but me —and that bus is sailing to a new world called Aracelis, Puerto Rico, cypresses line: the gaunt beaches she is: walking towards a limping and lost marine tamping out a marlboro where there is none. The sun like golden tokens in their eyes. he holds her hand: she agrees: his knees know exactly when to buckle as they walk. She’s gonna buy me some souvenirs: you will translate them: she forgot her suitcase: whose trembling hands scaled a v of birds in the sky? From now on: tonight I’m running to the bar, I’m wearing my grandmother’s fur coat, I’m bachataing right up to the bartender, I’m taking my rival El Boracho’s whiskey, I’m swirling the ice before his eyes: I’m pulling out handfuls and strings of my grandmother's jewelry: I’m draping them in my hair. I’m pulling down my aviators a little —I’m gonna pull back that whiskey, pull out my hand, look the mother of three children square in the face and say …vamos inside my suitcase there is light. The tombstone of a train ticket attached to the handle.

Metronome “you're rushing: have you a train? to catch”: the piano I stare into it like a dentist: my mouth unhinged and I descend until it, the music, bricks my spine: I have no choice: but to piss and loosen to unfunctional geometries on the carpet: you want to rotate the score 90 degrees for me: time passes: into ambulance: my metal bedpans bring you so much anger: yet: your forgotten love of Ray Charles: brings me to tears: once my hands were a v of birds: arpeggios: you called them: falling the piano’s 88 baby teeth remind me: “what is the point of living” :how delicately you respond with my pill box, when you say “it could not be any other way,” the seven trap doors: sky blue and transparent: I tremble for a glass of water: before I step out: you must hum a little and take your time tying my shoes: press down the knot with one finger: release the minor cadence: everything is strung 
on its balance: if you do not, all of it, everything will unassemble.

I have come, to sit in the day, slowly, watching 
The Venezuelan construction workers, who do not wonder
Why I have come to sit in the day, slowly,
and bend these brown hours. Or rather, I 
am trying to siphon syllables from 
grass and wild chives still crouching in the 
cold toes of March, their hands answer “yes”
to a question I expect only they recall
the grass’s poem:
(  O  )
     ...  
        ...
          ...
            ...
 i,i,i,i,i,( I ),i,i,i,i,i

my eyes
ask me to remove their lids
as falling bedsheets 
of pink dogwood petals
descend like little boys 
in broad parachutes like their
army father’s spindling to the ground
or a billowed bedsheet
their mother has just popped
the skin cells in the morning light
descend as pollen,
a flower like an explosion, an explosion
like the end of it all, a poet like
potted flowers and a poem like a hospital bed.
A famous alchemist
once turned his love into a dogwood tree
and felt shame, having thought himself
to do a loving thing, a preserving thing 
he was alone until he made a word 
for his solitude
I am, of course, talking about language,
in all its intended futility, as I have failed,
To attend not to my senses
you say life is bifurcated
and I, too, lift my feet and search for 
the knowledge of turning a glass until
The wind and the seasons comb something
through our hair,
resembling ash.

Rangers drag their shadows like open parachutes.
In a wheelchair one’s body slouches 
crumpling in the open suitcase of his fatigues like
A plastic takeout bag that says Thank You			
Thank you it weeds the wind of after-traffic; I do 
not know what to make of it. Your prophecy, Ishion. Of
three little boys pissing in the Adriatic
their industry exposed to sunlight till the bees did bloom

pinched the hems by the breakers. 
It pains me to say (Thank You)
you can know the deployment history of a military town
by the ethnicities of its churches. With crossed legs
the Korean wives sit with great posture, they know English 
only as a second loneliness. In the aisles
I saw them cart the seated siblings
plucking and bursting the red grapes 
testicular– regardless of purchase–there is dignity here.
but in her hometown there is no 
cemetery
 dark suits rent young husbands, back 
pockets heavy with delinquencies
–they bent like vines to italicize 
her name among roses, green awnings;


 
Cuando Trujillo

The sun strikes flint against the boughs, mangos ripe and fall into the parachute of their shadow. The rolling r’s of boots through the doorway and a wet cigar: the stuttering minute hand on his face. Pulling the muzzle of a rifle out of a birthday cake, he says in a caliber spanish: the past will never be what the future once was… 

In the beginning Jose Fernando dreamed that San Domingo was un viaje infinito in the sandy winds of another language he sailed inside a platano and dreamed of leaving this perverted plantation where …the past can never be what the future once was

Jesus Fernando stared down Jose Fernando’s rifle como el cowboy and gave his last words: Jesus Fernando’s hands shook a little as he tried to light a bent cigarette and said en el termino–in the end–at the end of the story–the gun is fired. 

The moon swells with milk through hallways behind my eyes and blooms a sanctuary of parenthesis where somewhere in the middle–en el medio–somewhere before the middle of the story: I ran salí corriendo yardas llenas con jeringas de jarrones rotos vidrio y metralla por las bodegas tapiadas a través de la escuela abandonada corrió a través de la línea de fuego y la bachata de tiro de pistolas directamente a través de la tierra de nadie Yo, Jesus Fernando jumped out of the poem where “The Past Can Never Be What The Future Once Was” 

To find his wife, to sleep with her as if, for the first time again. After the end he says, before the beginning, Jose Fernando found her as I had first saw her, there in the margins, under a mango tree wearing her father’s overalls–she is waiting for no one. To the vowels of her lips to the labials of her shoulder and elbow for the articulation of her wrist, I,  Jesus Fernando, en el medio (stood like a platano for a while) crossed over (el pasado) to her: 
as she gave my name, Jesus Fernando 
to the sandy winds of San Domingo






respiration: haiku violets   begin.
crest and exhale 
these subtle organs
like windpipes fugue me
breath ends there
are always only two and
the middle around
this bitter season laughs.
like my own personal stranger
the houses and trees.
vanish behind me
and a voice says
remember this
speaking in the first person.
on earth
the only thing that is
certain is
that
we enter
this world I wear
it like a mask
upon a terrored face












the granddaughters look over their shoulder
they do not need to be told to not cry
their hair on a scale weighed against mariupol sky
the grandfather smiles from his wheelchair
when the door closes he brings a fist to his legs
he feels the punching but not the blow
the grandson watches a youtube tutorial
on how to disassemble and reassemble a gun
an jar of pickles acid green beside him 
forgive me my son the man cries he throws
dirt on the coffin as if he was digging 
the widow of three months holds the flag
as the priest swings a censor in the subway
station a beautifully young woman 
becomes a clown and the children learn
to sing with the A# siren 














Hooked Instruments

After the men, through the breakers
with buckets of cold cod and tuna 
The monger carves through their bellies
and what is inside resembles petals.
it is a good smell, and it reminds the monger
of women. His boy wonders how a creature
that lives in water could smell so terrible.
We like the stench, and he too would stink
if opened. The fishes guts, we must imagine them like
dogwoods. The fisherman reads the sky like a bible,
and imagine God’s line bringing him upward 
quickly towards the blue firmament, he thinks he
will smash but instead he splashes 
through it and emerges in a world so beautiful
he can not breathe
You must choose: God or nothing. But 
the third option scares me most, 
that we all might be
canons aimed at the end
and my dentist was not surprised have heard on the radio that suicide 
rates increase during the holiday season. However, this is not true
 the Dentist says: the sky is like a mouth without a belly. It’s funny how he only starts a conversation with his hooked instrument in my mouth. 
It is not a good idea to take spiritual advise from 
either poets, dentists, or anyone else 
who hooks the lip of things in order to inspect the maw.

A Glass House for Angie


I am poor but I would make for you an archive of our bodies that 
we may return to    step back into before the shore departs after 

the onset of joint    pains      root canals and god-forbid brain 
cancer I learned the other day that rust is a type of burning

a quality of oxygen in our lungs makes us all slow fires a timer
on a frosty window swelling orange glow counts down to warm

apple pie in the oven on second thought this archive of bodies 
might be 1. terrifying      (consider the legion of mannequins 

that all look and do not look like me) even  worse 2. embarrassing
all my iterations (don’t look at July 2007 the chubby twelve year old

in all black sweating out hormones and his parents divorce into 
the emo-tunes of My Chemical Romance in a Supercuts parking lot

1 hour south of Disney World) ah look here the second week of a 
pandemic in March 2020 these two naked 20 something year old

bodies that make a room together               a window to Meadow St.
they dream into the blur of cars that can not see them that night 

I asked rather melodramatically     if we would destroy each other
I was thinking about anti-particles.    This ~archive of bodies~ also presents

many issues there is of course Zeno's paradox and the infinite cuts
of rulers and seconds making any finite amount of bodies impossible

in truth I know there are no boundaries and therefore no motion 
or bodies but that too scares me —Archie (not “my love”) today I 

said you (which can only ever be a statement about me) are not a 
conceptual poet but a formal carpenter of glass houses     shelters

that give space for motion to pass through I think if you could you 
would have written blank words and argued that they were organized

into stanzas (which is another word for ‘room’) but these would be 
just white sheets of paper and everyone would laugh at you so

artifice it is (I + word = worId  I suppose) the only job of a poet is 
to open      the beginning of a poem as a door for wind (here I go again: 

‘m’ being an upside down ‘w’ making wind into mind as well as ‘w’ 
being to ‘you’s which is  an invitation for ‘us’/’you’s) I would sit in this 

tiny house I’ve made for a long time with you, my beloved (not ‘Archie’)
watch you dance the fabric of you your dress space-time circling hem echo 

into air the movement of your previous step continuously until  
you stop in place tired and the fabric spins to soft a stop and you are 

older now and sheaths of dust virtualize the light through these many
many windows the photons     little bridges coalesce only on you 

to my eyes when I look at you you're the only thing I see the only 
thing light touches and stepping up with my cane I say to you

what a marvelous turn what a beautiful dance my love, this time I promise
I will rewrite this poem and have me dance with you, it’s just I’m so old
now I don’t want to ruin it    in this glass house there are many blows
many stones many hospital bills and debts but as Archie says: stones

are a kind of wind: on an axis: a sort of pressurizing and erosion: a 
colon: releasing shit which is life from death: I know these concepts 

are everything and therefore meaningless and annihilating but I 
am trying to make the shape of a body the shape of a house the shape 

of a poem a type of technology that I would have keep our bodies young forever 
((concept)idea + (form)matter = (poem)artifice) I need to make room for life) 

I would choose the dust of us over any sheet of paper —my youthful body 
(which I am neglectful of) I am ungrateful of its silence my lack of 

pain my body’s fingers and lips are roaring for your’s love, (get out of here 
Archie) I can archive my thoughts into poems	sure    but a poem 

is a virus especially a good poem it does not make any thing but make 
supposedly lonely people   want to write poems to overcome loneliness

when their love is in the other room waiting for pie. It is the body that 
makes poems. Is that you Archie? knocking on the back door? are

you coming to tell me of your toothaches? I would tell you that you 
should have written a poem reminding me to go to the dentist no that

isn't you, just another stone, you are dead, Archie, sure you have
your archive but you are without a body, but when i read you

does my body become your body's archive? Well this is my house and 
you better believe I wont be thinking any of your poems when I kiss her
my apologies, I do not have an archive for you, just this one glass body



Under a Plum Tree

the moon threads light through the pines broken 
loom cast on the porno theater across the bay he
hoped she would not turn away when he says prostate
cancer she is sorry she did his     mouth reaches 

far beyond her birthday silent the pine lifts or 
the moon falls a needle      eye or phantom pain
his hands press into her lap a tiny house January’s 
thirty odd stairs that sliver into a perhaps:

she fills a balloon with baby names so light 
they lift     kisses the cheek of the hour
wild with gutfire it blooms     maroon perfectly a snow 
plum she hands him how shared our mereness he thinks;

on the bench across the bay we watch the couple
I throw orchid petals into the water because
you have yet to place your hand on my knee
to sort the folds of my skirt ready to depart
a train of rubies in my heart;

in the theater Ruby a bald man garlanded silver drifts 
asleep so the usher drapes a coat over him which
he imagines      is a closet the moon or Ruby hangs 
themself up in every night Ruby’s dream wife asks where 
do you go? Ruby steps out of the usher’s coat 
like smoke and says   nowhere

Outside the Farmer’s Market

Erect	 in the knife-ice water headless 	stares into me this
naked wreckage of a willow is petrified 
lightning and    mast charred emerged from beneath
halves of its bow image   in the bend and glassy 
bay 	red shelves of lichen in the shape of
butterflies blossom on its first and now last 	
branch   which   as if it was	its solemn 
duty 	bares   the heaviness of all this blue 
sky as a skirt    of blue foliage     into the November of me
slides 	the betweenness       of me   into 	what keeps its drowned roots
from lifting? 		I would     remind this
willow that it 	is  dead    and 	should
lie down now in the warm soil	 that whatever
war     it is fighting	   is already lost     but 
there is another willow happening behind 
me, leaves hair dripping with braided green
its multiple trunks grew 	round a hollow  circle 
of parallel willows   churning like a very 
slow ocean      		you have to see it
I imagine 	      the broken willow in the water lingers
for this   			possibility          I’m scared that marriage is this
one       having to leave and the other forced to watch the leaving
when you text me I 	see 	there is a heat    in the farmer’s market people are such
slow fires   when you come I’ll show you the rosy the  babies with red wool beanies fuzzy 
scarves     no apocalypses for sale today   brushes of heirloom    leeks and 	endangered eucalyptus forged voices there are many     well-priced gifts you would like. Holding these Tibetan earrings     —a woman?      and rings 	silvering into perhaps         I am (a ghost)
slowly 	  	
walking 
through (you) 
a (distance) crowd     
looking   for   you 	—a woman	 (unveiling)      	a stranger
whose face (a glow, a touch) only you know
